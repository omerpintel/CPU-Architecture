LABS - VHDL Codes, first labs
Participants: Romi Lustig & Omer Pintel

----------------------------------

This Git includes 2 directories:
1. Concurrent_Codes
2. Sequential_Codes
Both will be explained further.

----------------------------------
Concurrent_Codes:
includes 6 .vhd files (no TB included), where the basic module is based on stractural modeling.
1. aux_package - includes all entities (for all of the components used)
2. top - top module, includes components: Adder, Shifter, Logic.
3. AdderSub - adder or substraction module. Includes component: FA.
4. FA - Full adder component.
5. Shifter - basic shifting component.
6. Logic - basic logic tasks, element-based.

----------------------------------
Sequential_Codes:
Includes 3 .vhd files (no TB included), 2 files were already given. This module completes basic arithmetic tasks.
1. aux_package - includes all entities, was given to us.
2. top - top module. We were asked to write the architecture, using processes.
3. Adder - adder module, was given to us.

----------------------------------

Enjoy!
